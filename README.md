# metadata_templates
JSON templates for creating standardized and interoperable CF and ACDD compliant internal file-level metadata for ocean earth science data products including different satellite and airborne processing levels, platforms and sampling techinques.

These include different templates for Level 2, L3 and L4 satellite/airborne products, ocean point moorings, CTD vertical profiles, trajectory drifting instruments. Although they were developed from ocean observing instruments they can be adapted to other earth observing instrumentation, platforms and sampling stategies.

The templates are designed to be used in an operational manner as a sets of key/value pairs.  The template provides the "key" (CF or ACDD metadata attribute) while a separate data processing program provides the "value". 

An example of how to use the templates in an operational and programatic sense is provided in the accompanying notebook tutorial.
